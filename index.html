    <!----------VOTING RIGHTS ACT------------>

      <h2>The Voting Rights Act of 1965</h2>
      <p>
        The Voting Rights Act, a landmark piece of federal civil rights legislation, was signed into law by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 
        to ensure that state and local governments do not impose discriminatory voting policies. The Act secured the right to vote
        for racial minorities throughout the US, especially in the South. It contains multiple ways to regulate elections, including
        provisions that outlaw literacy tests and other methods that governments had historically used to disenfranchise minorities. 
        Section 4(b) contains a "coverage formula" that determines which state and local governments are subject to the special provisions
        in Section 5, which include requiring federal approval, or "preclearance", before changing their election laws. 
        The formula covered districts which had a history of racially discriminatory voting policies, and mainly targeted the Deep South.

        </p> 
      <p>
        In 2013, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to invalidate Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder. This decision
        made the provisions in Section 5 unenforceable and allowed several states to impose restrictive election laws without advance federal approval.

      <h2>Restrictive Voting Measures</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: update text -->
        Photo ID laws, voter registration restrictions, voter purges, lack of polling places, felony disenfrachisement, 
        and gerrymandering are among the many ways that politicians restrict voting. These measures disporportionally target
        people of color, students, the elderly, and people with disabilities.
