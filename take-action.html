        <h2>How can you combat voter suppression?</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most important things you can do is vote. Vote for politicians who will protect voting rights and stand against
          voter suppression. If you are not eligible to vote, you can help others register to vote, along with signing petitions
          and calling your representatives to encourage them to pass voting rights legislation, such as the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.

        <h3>Script for contacting your senators about the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act: </h3>
        <p>
          Dear Senator [Last Name],
          <br>
        </p>
        <p style = "text-indent: 50px;">
          As you and fellow members of Congress mourn the passing of your House colleague, Representative John Lewis, I urge you to 
          honor his memory with meaningful action by passing the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act that passed as the Voting Rights 
          Advancement Act in the House last year. Seven years ago, the Supreme Court gutted the original Voting Rights Act in its 
          Shelby County v. Holder decision, paving the way for a resurgence of voter suppression laws and practices that disproportionately 
          disenfranchise Black voters. We need the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act to restore much-needed oversight of states when they 
          repeatedly try to enact racist voting laws, and to ensure that no state can make significant changes to how they conduct elections 
          without considering how those changes would impact voters of color. Please match the urgency of this moment in history and 
          Representative Lewisâ€™ lifelong commitment to civil rights by doing everything in your power to pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.
          
          <br>
          <br>
          Sincerely,
          <br>
          [Your Name]
        </p>
