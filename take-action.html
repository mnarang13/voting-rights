        <h2>How can you combat voter suppression?</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most important things you can do is vote. Vote for politicians who will protect voting rights and stand against
          voter suppression. If you are not eligible to vote, you can help others register to vote, along with signing petitions
          and calling your representatives to encourage them to pass voting rights legislation, such as the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.
